## Prerequisites

- You'll want experience with Node.js before you can install the dependencies and run the app.

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `12 || 14 || 15 || 16`
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup



```
git clone https://github.com/ELISHA1994/simple_blog_api.git
cd simple_blog_api
npm install
```

This may take a few minutes.

If you get any errors, please read through them and see if you can find out what
the problem is. 

If you can't get the setup script to work, then just make sure you have the
right versions of the requirements listed above, and run the following command:

```
npm install
```


## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up the API server.

You can also open the production deployment:
[simpleblogap.herokuappl](https://simpleblogap.herokuapp.com).

## Troubleshooting

<details>

  <summary>Node ExperimentalWarning on server start up</summary>

  These warnings' comes up on server start up because ElishaBello.dev import a json file (which is currently experimental) for the swagger documentation, it does not prevent the api server from running successfully

</details>
